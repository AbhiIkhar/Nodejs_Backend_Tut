# API AND Parameters

- DOTENV :
  It is if deploy my backend on cloud
  then if i have to pass the url of cloud in
  while connecting db so do i need to change it again no, there is env variable for that.

// How Backend and Frontend works?
--> In nodejs we will create the APIS
for : 1. CRUD operations 2. Authentication 3. Some I/O opperations

    In frontend there is fetch keyword in js
    In reactjs with fetch in different ways  (axios we use here)

// From browser we can only acces the get request

## Good practises

1. whenever u use async and await keyword u should use try-catch block  
   Error handling can also be done
2. Give status code also while responding.
3. For async and await we should use try-catch block .

## Dynamic Routing

1. query means the thing which we take from url.

## Route Splitting

--> Model View Controller

# Project Name : TODO list

Note : Best practise is first create the backend
then go for frontend.

## Time line

- Backend

  - TAR-1 : 4:00 - 4:30 -- Done
  - TAR-2 : 4:30 - 5:10 -- Done
  - TAR-3 : 5:10 - 5:36 -- Done

- Frontend
  - TAR-1 : 5:36 - 6:00
  - TAR-2 : 6:00 - 6:30
  - TAR-3 : 6:30 - Completion

## How to connect fronetend with the backend?

-->[In order to keep a website and its users secure from the security risks involved with sharing resources across multiple domains the use of CORS is recommended, but what is CORS? CORS, also known as Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allows resources such as JavaScript and web fonts to be loaded from domains other than the origin parent domain.]

frontend with the backend we need to use `cors` module . [check this](https://www.keycdn.com/support/cors)

# MongoDB :

A MongoDB cluster is a group of MongoDB servers that work together to hold and process data. The servers in a cluster ca. André Spiegel. Distinguished Engineer at MongoDB (company) (2013–present) 3y. A MongoDB cluster is several MongoDB servers working together.

## What is AJAX: --> Asyncronous javascript and XML

--> AJAX is a developer's dream, because you can:

Read data from a web server - after a web page has loaded
Update a web page without reloading the page
Send data to a web server - in the background

--> 1. AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page. 2. AJAX is not a programming language.
AJAX just uses a combination of:
A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)
