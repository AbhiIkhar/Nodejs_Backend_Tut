# API AND Parameters
  
  - DOTENV : 
        It is if deploy my backend on cloud
        then if i have to pass the url of cloud in
        while connecting db so do i need to change it again no, there is env variable for that.



// How Backend and Frontend works?
--> In nodejs we will create the APIS
    for :
       1. CRUD operations
       2. Authentication
       3. Some I/O opperations
    
    In frontend there is fetch keyword in js


// From browser we can only acces the get request


## Good practises
 
  1. whenever u use async and await keyword u should use try-catch block  
  Error handling can also be done
  2. Give status code also while responding.
  3. For async and await we should use try-catch block .
## Dynamic Routing 
  1. query means the thing which we take from url.


## Route Splitting
--> Model View Controller 



# Project Name :  TODO list 

Note : Best practise is first create the backend
       then go for frontend.
## Time line
- Backend
  -  TAR-1 : 4:00 - 4:30   -- Done
  -  TAR-2 : 4:30 - 5:10   -- Done
  -  TAR-3 : 5:10 - 5:36   -- 

- Frontend
  -  TAR-1 : 5:36 - 6:00
  -  TAR-2 : 6:00 - 6:30
  -  TAR-3 : 6:30 - Completion



## How to connect fronetend with the backend?
--> If frontend and backend url are different then we can not connect the
frontend with the backend so for that reason we need to use `cors` module . [check this](https://www.keycdn.com/support/cors)
